## Redesign/refactor of side and org navigation
Overall layout/styling refinements to side nav (desktop + mobile)
- Consolidates multiple org memberships into a popover "org picker"
- Currently selected org is saved in local storage so it is maintained across the platform (removed upon logout)
- Org management tabs are moved into side nav and display based on user's currently selected org
- Reduces height of header bar and adjusts main body content spacing to accommodate for that and removal of horizontal org tabs
- Simplifies user home page (only includes content specific to an individual user)
- Streamlines profile menu
- Adds "learn about FD" link into footer and updates layout
- Fixes Tabs value error that was stemming from the side nav
- Minor styling updates throughout
